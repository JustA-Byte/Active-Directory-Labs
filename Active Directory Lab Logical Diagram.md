## Introduction
The purpose of this step is to map out the logical diagram of this whole lab. This will help me understand how data may flow and how the different systems will communicate with one another.

## The Logical Diagram
Using the software available on <a href="draw.io"> draw.io </a>, I will create the logical diagram which includes the following systems:
- Splunk Server
- Active Directory Server
- Target machine
- Attacker machine
- Switch
- Router
- Internet
